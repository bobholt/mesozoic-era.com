Mesozoic-Era.com
================

Mesozoic-Era.com is intended to better explain the age of dinosaurs to a general
audience. When talking about time spans in the tens of millions of years, it's
easy to become disoriented. Most people probably think all dinosaurs lived
together at the same time and died off at the same time, when in reality there
was more time separating early dinosaurs from Tyrannosaurus Rex than there is
separating it from us.

Mesozoic-Era.com will try to not only catalog the current scientific
understanding of the Mesozoic Era (with references!), but will also try to
visualize these things in new and intuitive ways. Paleobiology will be the
focus, but paleobotany, paleogeology, and paleo* will be addressed.

Because dinosaurs are cool.
